# simpleAndroidToggleButton
simple android toggle button example and a delayed intent which opens my Linkedin page

Toggle button can be used to turn IOT machines or endpoints on and off

I delayed the pink envelope button (FloatingActionButton) so that you can read the snackbar message 
before being forwarded to my Linkedin page https://www.linkedin.com/in/mrjesseboyd 
by creating a runnable thread for that method.
